# Deep Reinforcement Learning for controlling Bomberman for Codefest 2022

This is a project for Codefest 2022. The goal is to create a bot that can play Bomberman using Deep Reinforcement Learning.

This repository contains the code for the bot, as well as the code for extracting the environment.

- GYM: For the environment, GYM can auto create room, train the bot, and repeat the game.
- DQN: For the Deep Reinforcement Learning bot
- Random, Nothing Bot: For mocking the other bots
- colab: using Google Colab as backend for running bots, can be run as shown in [this notebook: ./Reinforcement_AI_CODEFEST_2022.ipynb](./Reinforcement_AI_CODEFEST_2022.ipynb)
- data.json: sample ticktack data from server every second.

- Frontend inject by Tampermonkey [here: ./tampermonkey-front-end-inject-for-auto-training.js](./tampermonkey-front-end-inject-for-auto-training.js)
